# Lightbox History Visualization

Based on mostly hand-entered data from TMS, this d3-based project visualizes the full run of the Lightbox until August of 2017, showing each project as a colorful wedge highlighting collaborators (width of wedge, and connections to other wedges), span (angle of wedge around circle), and the wealth of projects over all.
